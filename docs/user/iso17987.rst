ISO17987
========

ISO17987 is the successor of the LIN2.2A standard, it clears up some of the confusing parts of the
standard. There are minor additions to the LDF syntax, but because the standard isn't freely
available **the library will only include support for things that are in the public domain** or that
others have moved into public domain, like example LDFs.

When contributing additional ISO17987 support keep in mind that access to the standard might come
with a non-disclosure agreement. Also when including LDFs in issues or PRs make sure that they
don't include confidential information.

Support
-------

As of ``0.19.0`` parts of ISO17987 are supported, the support is based on examples found on
Github.

The following attributes are supported:

* LIN_protocol_version/LIN_language_version with ISO version values
* LDF_file_revision as a string
* LIN_sig_byte_order_big_endian/LIN_sig_byte_order_little_endian

.. note:: LDF_file_revision is only available in the dictionary.

.. warning:: LIN_sig_byte_order_big/little_endian is only supported on grammar level, it's currently
             ignored by the parser and frame encoding/decoding doesn't support big endian mode.

Version values are converted into :py:class:`~.Iso17987Version` which contains the release year,
comparison operations are implemented.
